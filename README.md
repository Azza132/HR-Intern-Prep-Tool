HR INTERNSHIP PREP — README
==========================

A self-contained, browser-based study tool to help you prepare for HR internship interviews. No installation, no account, no internet connection required after opening the file.


GETTING STARTED
---------------
1. Download the file hr-internship-prep.html
2. Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. That's it — everything runs locally in your browser


NAVIGATING THE APP
------------------
The navigation bar at the top of the page gives you access to all seven sections. On mobile, tap the menu icon (three lines) to reveal the links. Click any section to jump straight to it.


THE SEVEN SECTIONS
------------------

HOME
The starting point. Gives you a quick overview of what the app contains, with clickable cards that link directly to each section.

STAR METHOD
Learn the foundational framework used in almost every behavioural interview. Read the breakdown of each letter (Situation, Task, Action, Result), study a fully worked example answer, and review the list of common mistakes to avoid. Spend time here first if you are new to behavioural interviews — understanding STAR makes everything else in the app more useful.

QUESTIONS
A bank of 20 HR-specific interview questions grouped into categories: Motivation, STAR Behavioural, HR Knowledge, Situational, and Self-Awareness. Each question has a Show Hints button. Click it to reveal bullet-point guidance on how to approach that specific question. Click again to hide the hints.

PRACTICE MODE
Simulate the real interview experience with a timed answer pad. A question is displayed and you can move between all 20 using the Prev and Next arrows. Press Start Timer to begin timing your answer, type your full STAR response into the text box, and use Show Hints if you get stuck. Press Clear Answer to reset when you are ready for the next attempt. Strong interview answers typically run 1.5 to 3 minutes, so practising with a timer helps you calibrate your pacing.

TIPS AND TRICKS
Practical advice organised into four tabs. Before the Interview covers research, preparation, and practice strategies. During covers in-the-room tactics and body language. After covers thank-you emails, reflection, and following up. The Do's and Don'ts tab gives a side-by-side summary of what to do and what to avoid. Click each tab to switch between them.

GLOSSARY
A searchable reference of 20 essential HR terms you are likely to encounter in job descriptions, interviews, and on the job. Scroll to browse all terms or type into the search bar to filter by keyword. Knowing this vocabulary and being able to use it naturally in your interview will set you apart from candidates who have not done their homework.

CHECKLIST
A fully interactive checklist covering five preparation phases: Research and Knowledge, Preparing Your Answers, Practical Preparation, On the Day, and After the Interview. Tick each item as you complete it and a progress bar tracks your overall completion. Your progress is automatically saved in your browser, so if you close the tab and come back your ticks will still be there. Work through this in the days leading up to your interview to make sure nothing is left to chance.


TIPS FOR GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THIS TOOL
-------------------------------------------
- Start with the STAR Method section if you are new to behavioural interviews, then move to Questions
- Use Practice Mode daily in the week before your interview — even one question a day makes a big difference
- Do not skip the Glossary — being able to use HR terminology naturally is something interviewers notice
- Tick off the Checklist as you go rather than all at once, it is designed to be used over several days
- On mobile the app is fully usable, great for reviewing on the go
